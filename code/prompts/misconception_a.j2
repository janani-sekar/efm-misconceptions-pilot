## Misconception A: Moving Terms Without Changing Signs

**Description:**
The student moves a term from one side of the equation to the other side but **FAILS to change its sign**.

**Key Pattern:**
When moving a term across the equals sign:
- A positive term should become negative
- A negative term should become positive

**Examples:**

✓ **CORRECT:**
```
Step 1: 3x + 5 = 2x + 10
Step 2: 3x - 2x = 10 - 5
```
(The +2x became -2x, the +5 became -5)

❌ **INCORRECT (Misconception A Present):**
```
Step 1: 3x + 5 = 2x + 10
Step 2: 3x + 2x = 5 + 10
```
(Failed to change signs when moving terms)

✓ **CORRECT:**
```
Step 1: Ax + b = cx + d
Step 2: Ax - cx = d - b
```

❌ **INCORRECT (Misconception A Present):**
```
Step 1: Ax + b = cx + d
Step 2: Ax + cx = b + d
```

**What to Look For:**
- Terms moved to opposite side of equals sign
- Signs did NOT change appropriately
- This makes ~3308 transitions incorrect in the dataset
