## Misconception C: Combining Unlike Terms

**Description:**
The student incorrectly combines a **coefficient** (the number in front of a variable) with a **constant** (a standalone number), treating them as if they were like terms.

**Key Pattern:**
The student treats `Ax + b` as if it could be combined into `(A+b)x` or similar incorrect forms.

**Key Concept:**
- **Like terms** have the SAME variable part: `3x` and `5x` are like terms
- **Unlike terms** have DIFFERENT variable parts: `3x` and `5` are NOT like terms
- A coefficient (with variable) and a constant (no variable) cannot be combined

**Examples:**

✓ **CORRECT:**
```
Step 1: 3x + 5 = 2x + 10
Step 2: 3x - 2x = 10 - 5
Step 3: x = 5
```
(Combined like terms: 3x and 2x)

❌ **INCORRECT (Misconception C Present):**
```
Step 1: 3x + 5 = 2x + 10
Step 2: 8x = 12x
```
(Incorrectly combined 3x with 5 to get 8x, and 2x with 10 to get 12x)

✓ **CORRECT:**
```
Step 1: 2(3x + 4) = 5x - 1
Step 2: 6x + 8 = 5x - 1
```

❌ **INCORRECT (Misconception C Present):**
```
Step 1: n(Ax + b) = cx + d
Step 2: n((A+b)x) = cx + d
```
(Incorrectly combined Ax and b inside parentheses)

❌ **INCORRECT (Misconception C Present):**
```
Step 1: Ax + b = cx + d
Step 2: (A+b)x = cx + d
```
(Combined coefficient A with constant b)

**What to Look For:**
- A term with a variable and a constant appearing in Step 1
- These being combined into a single term in Step 2
- The variable part staying the same but the coefficient changing incorrectly
- This makes ~2850 transitions incorrect in the dataset

**Common Manifestations:**
- `3x + 5` → `8x` (adding constant to coefficient)
- `2x - 7` → `-5x` (subtracting constant from coefficient)
- Distribution combined with this error: `2(x + 3)` → `2(4x)` → `8x`
