## Misconception B: Distributive Property Error

**Description:**
The student incorrectly applies the distributive property when multiplying a term across parentheses. They either:
1. Fail to distribute to all terms inside parentheses
2. Use incorrect operations (+ instead of ×)

**Key Pattern:**
When distributing `n(Ax + b)`, the student should get `n×Ax + n×b`, but instead produces something incorrect.

**Examples:**

✓ **CORRECT:**
```
Step 1: 2(3x + 4) = 5x - 1
Step 2: 6x + 8 = 5x - 1
```
(2 distributed to BOTH 3x and 4)

❌ **INCORRECT (Misconception B Present - Type 1):**
```
Step 1: 2(3x + 4) = 5x - 1
Step 2: 2×3x + 4 = 5x - 1  or  6x + 4 = 5x - 1
```
(Failed to distribute 2 to the 4)

❌ **INCORRECT (Misconception B Present - Type 2):**
```
Step 1: n(Ax + b) = cx + d
Step 2: n + Ax + b = cx + d
```
(Used + instead of ×)

✓ **CORRECT:**
```
Step 1: -3(2x - 5) = 4x + 1
Step 2: -6x + 15 = 4x + 1
```

❌ **INCORRECT (Misconception B Present):**
```
Step 1: -3(2x - 5) = 4x + 1
Step 2: -6x - 5 = 4x + 1
```
(Failed to distribute -3 to -5)

**What to Look For:**
- Parentheses with a coefficient in Step 1
- Parentheses removed in Step 2
- NOT all terms properly multiplied by the coefficient
- This makes ~702 transitions incorrect in the dataset
